//! Distributed nodes: connect two Brood runtimes over TCP and route messages
//! between them. Erlang-style distribution falls out of share-nothing +
//! copy-on-send — *the network is just a longer copy* (ADR-013, `concurrency.md`).
//!
//! **Slice 1 (this module):** node naming, an authenticated TCP handshake (a
//! shared cookie, like Erlang's — *not* real security yet), and
//! location-transparent [`send`](crate::process::send) to a remote process. A
//! process is addressed either by a [`Value::Pid`](crate::core::value::Value::Pid)
//! — which carries node identity, so the same value works locally or across the
//! link — or, to bootstrap before you hold a peer's pid, by a `{:name :node}`
//! registered-name address.
//!
//! **One node per OS process.** The node identity, connection table, name table
//! and symbol interner are process-global, so a "node" *is* the OS process; two
//! nodes are two `brood` processes (typically over loopback). Deferred to later
//! slices: remote `spawn`/code shipping, distributed monitors, node-down
//! detection, reconnect, and real auth/TLS.
//!
//! ## Threads (off the green-process scheduler)
//! Each connection owns two plain OS threads — a **reader** (decodes inbound
//! frames and hands messages to [`process::deliver`]) and a **writer** (drains an
//! `mpsc` channel onto the socket). They never touch the coroutine scheduler;
//! inbound messages land in a local mailbox exactly as an in-process `send` would.
//!
//! ## Wire codec
//! Hand-rolled and length-prefixed (`[u32 len][payload]`). It reuses the existing
//! [`Message`] deep-copy, with one cross-process detail: **symbols travel by
//! name**, re-interned on arrival, because separate runtimes have independent
//! interners.
