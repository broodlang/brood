# RUNTIME-region collection — exploration notes

## The problem (recap)

The shared RUNTIME code region (`RuntimeCode.code`, `heap.rs`) is an **append-only**
set of `boxcar::Vec` slabs (pairs/vectors/maps/strings/ropes/closures/envs).
Append-only is *why* reads are lock-free and return stable references — process
threads dereference closure bodies without locking while another process `def`s.
Every `def`/hot-reload `promote`s new code in; the superseded version is **never
freed**. The `closures_structurally_equal` dedup (ADR-042) skips a re-append when
the new code is identical to the current binding (save-without-change / formatter
churn), but any *real* edit accumulates.

## Leak, quantified (this exploration)

Redefining a small fn `(fn (x) (+ (* x i) i) (- x i))` N times, each body
structurally distinct (so dedup can't skip), max RSS:

| redefs | max RSS | wall |
|---|---|---|
| 1,000 | 9.3 MB | 0.01 s |
| 20,000 | 28.2 MB | 0.12 s |

≈ **1 KB per redefinition** of a small fn (bigger bodies / nested closures: a few
KB). So ~19 MB / 20k redefs — matching the Stage-5 estimate. Negligible for a
normal session; **real for a multi-day server** (an editor-as-server hot-reloading
across many connections) — single-day heavy editing is tens of MB, multi-day could
reach hundreds.

## The two shapes (Stage 5), assessed against the code

1. **Free-list slab** — reclaim individual dead cells. Abandons `boxcar`'s
   lock-free stable refs: a global read happens on *every* operator/prelude call,
   so adding locking or epoch-protection to RUNTIME reads regresses the hottest
   path in the system. **Bad trade.** Rejected.

2. **Compacting copy at a runtime-wide safepoint** (favored) — trace live RUNTIME
   code, copy it to a fresh region, rewrite every handle, swap. Preserves lock-free
   reads *between* collections. This is a **moving GC over shared, cross-process
   state**, and needs four things, three of which don't exist yet:
   - **(a) Runtime-wide stop-the-world.** *None exists* — the GC (ADR-035) is
     strictly per-process; processes are pinned to worker threads and coordinate
     only via per-worker queues. A RUNTIME collection must pause **every** process
     of the runtime at a safepoint at once (signal all workers → each brings its
     current coroutine to a safepoint and parks → confirm all parked → collect →
     resume). New concurrency machinery — and concurrency is exactly where this
     codebase has had subtle races (`docs/claude-demo-findings.md`).
   - **(b) Trace from all roots across all processes** (inventory below).
   - **(c) Rewrite every RUNTIME handle everywhere** — globals + every process's
     roots/stack/heap/envs/mailbox/`vm_cache`. (LOCAL handles carry a generation
     epoch for the per-process moving GC; RUNTIME handles do **not** — they'd need
     a forwarding map keyed by old index.)
   - **(d) Swap the `boxcar` under its `Arc`** — only safe inside the STW pause.

## Root inventory — what a trace must cover

The live set = everything reachable from these, transitively through RUNTIME code:

- **`runtime.globals`** — the current bindings; the primary live roots. (Old
  versions are dead *unless* a process still holds a handle to one.)
- **Per process:** the operand stacks (`roots` + `env_roots`), the LOCAL heap
  (a closure/value that captured a RUNTIME handle — e.g. a closure stored in data
  or sitting in a mailbox), env chains, and **in-flight call frames** (a process
  mid-call to a now-superseded version — append-only is what makes that safe
  today; a collector must keep those versions live).
- **⚠ Per-process `vm_cache` (new — the Stage-5 note predates the VM, ADR-076).**
  `Heap::vm_cache` maps `VmCacheKey` → `Arc<CompiledClosure>`. It references RUNTIME
  code **two ways**: the keys are RUNTIME handles (`Runtime(closure.0)` /
  `LocalBody(body_pair.0)`), and the cached `Node` trees hold RUNTIME `Const`
  handles + the `MakeClosure` arms hold RUNTIME body `Value`s. A RUNTIME collector
  must account for it. **Cheapest correct option: clear every process's `vm_cache`
  during the STW pause** — it's a pure compile cache, rebuilt lazily on next call,
  so dropping it loses only warm-up, not correctness. (Rewriting it would be far
  more work for no benefit.)
- **Not code:** `def_sites` holds `SourceLoc` (file + position), not code handles —
  safe to leave (or rewrite trivially).

## Recommended incremental path

- **Step 0 — quantify (done, above).** ~1 KB/redef; deferral remains justified for
  desktop sessions, flagged for long-lived servers.
- **Step 1 — a *mark-only* reclaimable estimator (safe). ✅ prototyped on this
  branch.** `Heap::runtime_live_closure_count` marks RUNTIME closures reachable from
  `globals` + the process roots (walking the shared code graph: closure arms,
  captured RUNTIME envs, pairs/vectors/maps), moving and freeing nothing. The gap to
  `runtime_closure_count` is the reclaimable set. Validated by
  `tests/runtime_collector.rs`: **after 3000 distinct redefs of one fn,
  total=3001, live=2, reclaimable=2999** — i.e. ~100% of the churn is reclaimable
  and the mark correctly finds the 2 live closures (current `f` + `redef`). Next:
  surface it from Brood (`(runtime-code-stats)` / extend `(gc-stats)`) and extend
  the mark to all processes' roots for a multi-process-accurate figure. This makes
  the leak **observable** and de-risks the real collector with none of the
  STW/moving hazard.
- **Step 2 — the STW compacting collector (its own stage + ADR).** Decomposed:
  - **2a — evacuation core. ✅ done (out-of-place, branch `runtime-gc`).**
    `Heap::runtime_evacuate` traces the live RUNTIME code from globals + roots and
    *copies* it into a fresh `CodeSlabs`, building an old→new forwarding map —
    mirroring the LOCAL GC's `flush_*` but over `boxcar`/`OnceLock` and RUNTIME
    handles (closures/envs use `OnceLock` reserve-then-fill for cycles; pairs/
    vectors/maps are acyclic immutable code, so child-first then push-once).
    `verify_rt_slabs` confirms every handle in the evacuated region is in-bounds (no
    missed rewrite). Validated: after 3000 redefs, evacuate → 2 live closures of
    3001, verifier passes, program unchanged (`tests/runtime_collector.rs`).
    **Installs nothing — cannot corrupt the live region.**
  - **2b — in-place collect. ✅ done (branch `runtime-gc`).** `Heap::runtime_collect`
    + the `(runtime-collect)` builtin. **Gated on `Arc::get_mut`** — runs only when
    this heap uniquely owns the runtime region (no concurrent reader), so it's sound
    *without* stop-the-world; returns `:ran false` when the runtime is shared. One
    pass: every RUNTIME handle in globals + both LOCAL generations + roots/env_roots/
    dynamics is evacuated-and-rewritten; the `vm_cache` + `global_ic` are cleared;
    the compacted region is swapped in (`mem::take` avoids the borrow conflict).
    Validated: reclaims 2999/3001
    after churn; program correct afterwards incl. a RUNTIME closure held in a LOCAL
    binding *across* a collect (`(let (g f) (runtime-collect) (g 3))`); green under
    `BROOD_GC_STRESS=1 BROOD_GC_VERIFY=1`; full suite 437/437 both engines.
    **Bounds memory** — 40k redefs: no-collect 34 MB (growing) vs periodic collect
    14.5 MB (flat). The Stage-5 goal, for the single-process case.
  - **2b-auto — automatic safepoint trigger. ✅ done (branch `runtime-gc`).** The
    eval safepoint now calls `Heap::maybe_runtime_collect` (the shared-code analog of
    the LOCAL `collect`), so the single-process case is bounded with **no explicit
    `(runtime-collect)`** — the builtin is now just the force form. **Safe at exactly
    the points the LOCAL collect is**: it only *rewrites* RUNTIME handles (never moves
    LOCAL data), and the rooted set it touches — globals + `roots`/`env_roots`/
    `dynamics` + both LOCAL generations — is the same ADR-061 invariant the LOCAL
    safepoint relies on (so the VM's frame slots on `roots` are covered), plus the
    live `expr`/`env` passed in via `runtime_collect_with`; gated on the same
    `!macro_block_active()` condition. **Adaptive trigger** `rt_gc_threshold`: a
    closure-count floor (`rt_gc_floor()` — 4096 default, ~4 MB of churn; 256 under
    `BROOD_GC_STRESS`, nonzero like `major_floor` so stress doesn't recompact every
    safepoint; `BROOD_RT_GC_FLOOR` override), reset to `max(floor, 2*live)` after a
    real collect. A **shared** runtime (collect can't run without 2c) backs off
    `2*count` so a multi-process runtime attempts only O(log) times as it grows.
    Tests: `auto_safepoint_collect_bounds_runtime_region` (6000 redefs → region stays
    ~1900 ≪ 6000, `f` still correct); green under `BROOD_GC_STRESS=1
    BROOD_GC_VERIFY=1`. The manual-path tests opt out via `set_rt_auto_collect(false)`.
  - **2c — runtime-wide stop-the-world (design; the race-prone part, deferred).**
    Lets the collector run when *other processes are live* — today 2b's `Arc::get_mut`
    gate skips (`:ran false`) because parked processes still hold runtime-`Arc`
    clones. Grounded in the scheduler as it is:
    - **No central heap registry.** A *running* `Process` (and its `Heap`) is **not
      reachable from any registry** (`scheduler.rs:519`) — heaps are scattered across
      worker coroutine stacks (running), per-worker run queues, and mailbox waiters
      (parked). So a central collector *cannot* iterate all heaps to rewrite them.
    - **Parked vs running split.** A process parked in `receive` is suspended (its
      coroutine yielded) and won't reach an eval safepoint until woken — so it can't
      *cooperatively* rewrite itself. But its `Heap` **is** reachable, via its
      registry-reachable mailbox (`mailbox.state.waiter`). Queued processes are
      reachable via the per-worker queues. ⇒ a **hybrid**: *running* processes
      rewrite their own heap at the STW safepoint (they hold `&mut heap`); *parked/
      queued* ones are rewritten centrally by the coordinator (reachable + not
      executing → safe to mutate).
    - **Swappable region required.** Under STW the runtime `Arc` is still multiply
      cloned, so the swap can't use `get_mut`; `RuntimeCode.code` must become
      interior-mutable-swappable. `arc_swap::ArcSwap<CodeSlabs>` keeps reads ~lock-
      free (atomic load) — vs `RwLock` which taxes the every-call code-read path
      (the original Stage-5 objection). Read-path cost is the key tradeoff to measure.
    - **Protocol:** request a collection epoch (atomic on `RuntimeCode`) → workers
      bring running processes to the existing eval safepoint + barrier; coordinator
      evacuates the shared region once (→ forwarding map) → running procs rewrite own
      heap, coordinator rewrites parked/queued heaps + globals, all clear `vm_cache`/
      `global_ic`, barrier → atomic-swap the region → resume.
    This is **M4-server-scale concurrency infrastructure** — the single largest,
    most race-prone remaining kernel piece (the project's known races live in the
    scheduler). Deferred to a dedicated effort with the full `BROOD_GC_STRESS` +
    concurrency-fanout rig. **2b already bounds memory for the single-process /
    quiescent case**, which covers the practical near-term need; 2c waits until a
    long-lived *multi-process* server session actually hurts (the Stage-5 principle).
  Build only as far as a real session needs (per the Stage-5 principle).

## Effort / risk

**Status:** Steps 1, 2a, 2b, and 2b-auto are **done and on `main`** — the single-
process / quiescent case is fully bounded *automatically* (no `(runtime-collect)`
call needed), validated under `BROOD_GC_STRESS`/`VERIFY`. The remaining piece, **2c
(runtime-wide stop-the-world)**, stays deferred: it's the single largest and most
race-prone kernel piece (the project's known races live in the scheduler), it's
only needed for a long-lived **multi-process** server that never quiesces, and it
requires contorting the hot code-read path (swappable region) — so it waits for a
demonstrated need (per ADR-011 / the dogfooding principle), accepting a slow,
bounded, non-corrupting leak in that one not-yet-real scenario.
