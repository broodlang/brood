## 2026-05-27 — Project bootstrap and v0.1 language core

**Goal.** Stand up a new dynamic Lisp in Rust whose purpose is to be the
language a modern, Emacs-like, remotely-hostable, self-editing editor is written
in. First concrete target from the user: *"a light first version where
`(+ 1 2)` works."*

**Decisions taken** (full rationale in [decisions.md](decisions.md)):
- Host language: **Rust** (ADR-001), reaffirmed against C/Zig given the
  "heavily vibe-coded" constraint — memory safety is the key guardrail.
- Memory: `Rc`/`RefCell` now, tracing GC later (ADR-002).
- Cons-cell lists + separate `[ ]` vectors (ADR-003).
- Clojure-style truthiness; flat `cond` (ADR-004).
- Zero external dependencies for v0.1 (ADR-005).
- Maximise the share of the language written in Brood itself (ADR-006).

**Built.**
- Cargo workspace: `crates/lisp` (the language) + `crates/cli` (the `brood`
  binary), `std/prelude.lisp`, `docs/`.
- `value.rs`: `Value` enum, thread-local symbol interner, list/vector
  constructors, structural `PartialEq`.
- `reader.rs`: recursive-descent parser (numbers, strings, symbols, keywords,
  lists, vectors, `'` quote, `;` comments).
- `env.rs`: lexical environment chain with `get`/`set_existing`/`define`/`root`.
- `eval.rs`: tree-walking evaluator built as a `'tail: loop` for **proper tail
  calls**; special forms `quote if when unless cond do def set! fn/lambda
  let/let* and or while`.
- `builtins.rs`: arithmetic, comparison/logic, list & sequence ops, higher-order
  (`map`/`filter`/`reduce`/`apply`), predicates, strings/IO, and the
  self-hosting trio `eval`/`read-string`/`load`.
- `printer.rs`: readable + display rendering that round-trips with the reader.
- `cli/main.rs`: dependency-free REPL (balanced-delimiter multiline input) and
  file runner.
- `tests/basic.rs`: 16 end-to-end tests.

**Verified.**
- `cargo build` clean; `cargo test` → 16/16 plus the lib doc-test green.
- The headline guarantee holds: a tail-recursive sum to **1,000,000** returns
  without overflowing the stack.
- Live redefinition works: redefining a global function changes behaviour
  immediately (the seed of "edit the editor on the fly").
- REPL: `(+ 1 2)` → `3`. File runner: a recursive `fib` program prints
  correctly.

**Notable bug found & fixed.** First test run: `cond` returned a wrong branch.
Root cause was a mismatch between an initial Scheme-style clause-list `cond` and
the intended flat Clojure-style pairs. Switched the implementation to flat
`test expr` pairs with `else`/`:else` fallback (ADR-004); all green after.

**Status.** v0.1 = the ✅ slice of M1 in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md). Next up to
finish M1: macros + quasiquote, dynamic variables, in-language error handling,
maps, and the GC migration.

### Follow-ups (same day)

- **`bin/cli`** launcher script added (builds + runs the CLI from any directory).
- **REPL line editing.** Added `rustyline` (first external dependency, sanctioned
  by ADR-005) so the interactive REPL has arrow-key editing, history
  (`~/.Brood_history`), and Emacs-style bindings. Multi-line forms are handled
  by accumulating lines until delimiters balance. Non-terminal stdin (pipes,
  scripts) falls back to a plain reader that prints results only.
- **Principle reinforced by the user:** *as much of the language/system as
  possible must be written in Brood itself* (Rust = mechanism, Brood =
  policy), and the CLI/REPL should eventually be self-hosted in Brood. Captured
  prominently in `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/roadmap.md` (extends ADR-006). The
  current Rust REPL is an explicit bootstrap, not the end state.

### Primitive-kernel refactor + spec (same day)

- **Shrank the Rust builtins to a primitive kernel** and moved the user-facing
  functions into `std/prelude.lisp`: `+ - * /` (variadic, over 2-arg `%add`…),
  `< <= > >= = not=` (over `%lt`/`%eq`), `not number? list? car cdr list map
  filter reduce fold reverse append count nth …` are now ordinary Brood `def`s.
  Rust keeps only `%`-numeric ops, `cons/first/rest/empty?`, vector/string
  primitives, type-tag predicates, I/O, and `eval/read-string/load/apply`.
  Recorded as ADR-008.
- **Cost & adjustment:** Brood arithmetic is ~10× slower than the old native
  loop. The tail-recursion test ran ~50s at 1,000,000 iterations, so it was
  right-sized to **100,000** (still proves O(1) stack; suite back to ~5.5s).
  Tradeoff noted as reversible (future specialiser / re-promotion of hot ops).
- **Answered two design questions from the user and wrote them down:**
  - Brood is a **Lisp-1** (single namespace) — ADR-007. This is what makes the
    refactor above possible (`+` is just a value).
  - Added a **formal spec**, `docs/spec.md` (EBNF lexical/reader grammar, data
    model, evaluation + tail-position rules, scoping, special forms, the
    kernel/derived split, errors, and what's deliberately unspecified).
- Removed a now-unused `truthy` import; build is warning-clean. Tests: 16/16
  green.

### Macros + `defn` (same day)

- User asked for function definitions next, and chose the principled route:
  build macros, then define `defn` in Brood (rather than a quick Rust special
  form).
- **Added the macro system:** a `Value::Macro`, the `defmacro` and `quasiquote`
  special forms, macro expansion wired into the evaluator's `'tail` loop
  (macros resolve after special forms, before application, and expansions are
  re-looped so they get TCO + further expansion), the `macros.rs` module
  (quasiquote expansion, `macroexpand`/`macroexpand-1`), and `gensym`.
- **Quasiquote syntax decided (ADR-009):** Clojure-style `` ` `` / `~` / `~@`,
  and `,` is now whitespace. This matched the preview the user approved and the
  rest of the Clojure-leaning surface. Reader updated accordingly.
- **`defn` is now a macro in `std/prelude.lisp`**, and the whole prelude was
  rewritten to define its functions with `defn` (dogfooding). Also added `->`
  and `->>` threading macros, whose bodies compute the expansion with `reduce`
  at expansion time — a nice demonstration that macros are just Brood.
- Tests: added `defn`, user-macro/quasiquote, and threading cases. 19/19 green
  (~6.8s). REPL spot-checks: recursive `fib`, a custom `unless2` macro, and
  `->` all behave.
- Docs updated across the board: `spec.md` (§3 reader grammar, §7.2/7.3
  quasiquote + macros, §9 kernel list, §11), `language.md` (Macros section +
  builtins), `roadmap.md` (macros/quasiquote ticked), `decisions.md` (ADR-009),
  `README.md`.

### Lists for code, vectors for data; the parameter grammar (same day)

Prompted by the user's "all are lists" observation, a design conversation about
parameter lists and the broader role of vectors:

- **ADR-010 — code is cons-lists; vectors are a data type.** Reverses ADR-003's
  "vectors as the parameter surface." Parameter lists and `let` bindings are now
  written as lists — `(defn f (x y) …)`, `(let (a 1 b 2) …)` — for homoiconic
  code (which matters for a self-editing editor). `[ ]` vectors stay as a
  first-class *data* type (O(1) indexing) and are still accepted in
  param/binding positions. The prelude was rewritten entirely in list form.
- **ADR-011 — favor the simplest user-facing design; defer power features.** We
  designed the full CL-grade parameter grammar (`&optional`/`&key`/required-keys
  /supplied-p) and then cut it to **`required` + `&optional` (with defaults) +
  `& rest`**. `&key`, supplied-p, and required-keyword markers are deferred
  (designed, additive later). Recorded the principle in `CLAUDE.md` too.
- **Defined the grammar** formally in spec §7.4 (EBNF + binding/arity rules).
- **Implemented `&optional`** in the closure calling convention
  (`parse_params`/`bind_params`), so it works uniformly in `fn`, `lambda`, and
  `defn` — chosen over `defn`-macro sugar to avoid a footgun (raw `fn` silently
  treating `&optional` as a parameter name) and bootstrapping complexity.
  Defaults are evaluated lazily, left-to-right, so a default can reference an
  earlier parameter. Unknown `&markers` are rejected.
- Tests: added list-param, list-`let`, and `&optional` cases — 22/22 green.
- Docs synced: `spec.md` §7.4 + §4, `language.md` (Parameter lists section,
  examples to list form), `README.md`, `roadmap.md`, `decisions.md`
  (ADR-010/011), `CLAUDE.md`.

### Error handling (same day)

- First wrote a kernel inventory (`docs/primitives.md`) at the user's request,
  then added error handling under "the language must be as small as possible":
  **+2 primitives, 0 new special forms.**
- Kernel: `throw` (raise a value) and `%try` (call a thunk; on raise call a
  handler). `LispError` gained a `payload: Option<Value>` and a `User` kind.
- Prelude (Brood): `error` (raise a formatted message), and `try`/`catch` as a
  **macro** desugaring to `(%try (fn () body) (fn (e) handler))`; plus `last`
  and `but-last` helpers it needs.
- `catch` binds the thrown value, or — for built-in errors — the error's message
  string (the simplest choice, ADR-011; structured errors can come with maps).
- Tests: throw/catch, no-throw passthrough, built-in error caught as string,
  `error`, no-catch `try`, uncaught propagation. 24/24 green.
- Docs: `primitives.md` (proposal → implemented), `spec.md` §9/§10/§11,
  `language.md` (Errors section), `roadmap.md`.

### Test runner: progress dots + timing (same day)

- User asked the test framework to show progress (`.`s) and report how long a
  run took. Kept the kernel growth minimal: **+1 primitive, the rest in Brood.**
- Kernel: `now` — wall-clock milliseconds since the Unix epoch as an integer
  (`SystemTime`). Reading the clock genuinely needs Rust; elapsed time is then
  just a subtraction in Brood. 45 primitives now.
- `std/test.lisp` rewritten: assertions (`is`/`assert=`/`assert-error`) now
  *record* a pass or a failure instead of printing inline. `run-each` prints one
  `.` per test (`F` if it recorded a failure) for a live progress line; failure
  details collect in `*failures*` and print afterwards under `FAILURES:`; the
  summary reports `N tests, M assertions, K failed (T ms)`.
- The timer immediately earned its keep: it surfaced that the suite takes ~5.7s
  in the debug build, dominated by the `sum-to 100000` tail-call test.
- Docs: `primitives.md` (Time category, count 44→45), `language.md` (Time
  section).
