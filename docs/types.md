# Brood types — set-theoretic, gradual, advisory

**Status:** steps 1–2 done; 3–4 started — a v0 advisory checker (`(check 'form)`)
is the lattice's first consumer (`crates/lisp/src/types/{mod,check}.rs`). This doc is the
plan *and* the compatibility contract: the staircase says what to build next, the
[Compatibility contract](#compatibility-contract) says what every other change
must respect so we never drift off this path. Decision recorded in
[ADR-024](decisions.md) (refining [ADR-023](decisions.md)).

## The decision, in one paragraph

Brood's types follow the **Elixir model — set-theoretic and gradual** — not
TypeScript's pragmatic-but-unsound one. A type *is a set of values*; subtyping is
set inclusion; what can't be pinned down statically is `dynamic()` and mixes
soundly with the rest. Checking is **advisory**: it warns and optimises, it never
rejects a runnable program (the one exception — provably-sound special-form
*structure* errors — can't be wrong because special forms aren't redefinable).
The language stays fully dynamic; types never inhibit it. Mechanism lives in Rust
(`Ty`, the `Tag` atoms, primitive signatures); policy (`assert-type`, contracts)
lives in Brood (ADR-006).

Reading: Castagna, Duboc, Valim, *"The Design Principles of the Elixir Type
System"* (‹Programming›, 2024; on arXiv) and the semantic-subtyping / set-theoretic
lineage behind it.

## The model

A `Ty` **is a set of values**, and the type operations *are* set operations:

| Type op | Set op | In `types/mod.rs` |
|---|---|---|
| union (`int \| float`) | `∪` | `Ty::union` (bitwise OR) |
| intersection | `∩` | `Ty::intersect` (AND) |
| negation ("not nil") | `¬` | `Ty::negate` (complement) |
| **subtyping** | `⊆` inclusion | `Ty::is_subtype` — *semantic*, no syntactic rules |

- **Atoms** are the 12 runtime [`Tag`](../crates/lisp/src/core/value.rs)s
  (`int float string symbol keyword bool nil pair vector fn macro native`). The
  type universe is built from these; `type-of` observes one at runtime.
- `Ty::NEVER` = `⊥` (empty set, subtype of everything); `Ty::ANY` = `⊤` (all
  tags); the named unions `Ty::NUMBER` (`int∪float`), `Ty::LIST` (`nil∪pair`)
  match the `number?`/`list?` predicates.
- **`dynamic()`** *(step 2, `GradualTy`)* is the **gradual** type — and it
  lives *inside* the set-theoretic algebra, not bolted beside it. It's a bounded
  type `dynamic(bound)` (pure `dynamic()` = `dynamic(ANY)`) whose `bound` is an
  ordinary set-of-tags `Ty`, read as the interval between its optimistic (`⊥`)
  and pessimistic (`⊤`) materialisations. Crucially, **consistent subtyping is
  *derived from* ordinary set inclusion** — not a separate, non-set "consistency"
  axiom (the classic Siek–Taha framing). For our flat lattice the derived rule is
  simply: `dynamic(b)` is consistent-compatible with `t` iff `b ∩ t ≠ ⊥` (some
  materialisation fits); static-vs-static stays plain `<:`. So `dynamic()`
  composes with `∪`/`∩`/`¬` like any type and honours [contract point
  #2](#compatibility-contract). Anything whose type can't be pinned — above all a
  **redefinable global under hot reload** — is `dynamic()`, **not** `ANY` (`ANY`
  relates by subtyping and *would* error when an `int` is wanted; `dynamic()`
  defers). This is the valve that lets typing coexist with live redefinition.
  (Castagna & Lanvin, ICFP 2017; Castagna et al., POPL 2019 — the reconciliation
  Elixir uses.) **Note:** the advisory *checker* (Step 4) doesn't use `GradualTy`
  — it carries `Option<Ty>` (known / unknown). `dynamic()` is foundation for a
  later gradual-*assignment* checker, not the disjointness pass.
- **Structured types** (function arrows `int -> int`, a vector's element type)
  are a later step; today `Ty` is flat (sets of tags only).

## The staircase — tackle one at a time

Each step is self-contained, ships green, and is useful on its own. "Done when"
is the checkable boundary.

### Step 0 — runtime tags first-class ✅ (ADR-023)
First-class `Tag` + `(type-of x)`, self-identifying type errors, and an `Arity`
on every builtin enforced at one gate (`eval::call_native`).
**Done:** tag is observable; errors name op/wanted/got; arity is metadata.

### Step 1 — the set-theoretic `Ty` lattice ✅
`crates/lisp/src/types/mod.rs`: `Ty` as a set of tags with union/intersect/negate/
difference, semantic subtyping, `NEVER`/`ANY`/`NUMBER`/`LIST`, `of_value` bridge,
`Display`. Pure algebra; nothing in the language consumes it yet.
**Done:** the algebra exists and is unit-tested in isolation.

### Step 2 — `dynamic()`, the gradual type ✅
`types/mod.rs`: `GradualTy { bound: Ty, dynamic: bool }` — `dynamic(bound)` kept
*inside* the lattice (pure `dynamic()` = `dynamic(ANY)`). `consistent_with` is
**derived from set inclusion** (static → `bound ⊆ expected`; dynamic → `bound ∩
expected ≠ ⊥`), not a primitive consistency axiom — so pure `dynamic()` is
consistent with every inhabited type while `dynamic(number)` is still caught
against `string`. Joins branch types via `union`; gradual `intersect`/`negate`
are deferred until a consumer needs them (ADR-011 — don't ship unproven
operators). The "redefinable/free/global references are `dynamic()`" rule is
documented (the struct doc + ADR-024); no checker consumes it yet.
**Done:** the gradual type and its derived relation exist and are unit-tested.

### Step 3 — signatures the checker reads ✅
A callee's signature (argument `Ty`s + result `Ty`) comes from three sources,
simplest-first — deliberately **no inference engine** (see the rationale in
[How it runs](#how-it-runs--and-why-its-outside-the-runtime)):

- ✅ **Primitives** — every [`NativeFn`](../crates/lisp/src/core/value.rs)
  carries a [`Sig`](../crates/lisp/src/types/mod.rs) field next to its `Arity`
  (compatibility-contract point #6, **enforced** — there's no way to construct
  a `NativeFn` without one). The checker reads it via a global-env lookup
  (`check::primitive_sig`); there is no parallel hand-maintained table.
  Primitives whose args/result aren't usefully pinned use the explicit
  `Sig::any()` lane (`(...any) -> any`) — overlaps every input, so the
  disjointness checker never warns against it.
  Example sigs: `%add: (number,number)→number`, `first: (list|vector)→any`,
  `string-length: (string)→int`, `string->number: (string)→number|nil`.
- ✅ **Curated stdlib** — a small hand-written table for the variadic /
  `reduce`-based / higher-order Brood closures the checker can't infer but that
  matter: `+ - * / < <= > >= mod`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`. Hand-vetted, so
  sound. This is what makes `(+ 1 "x")` catchable even though `+` is
  `(reduce %add 0 xs)`.
- ✅ **Basic inference** (`check::infer_sig`) — *only* for a fn whose body is a
  **single straight-line expression** (no `if`/`cond`/`when`/`let`/`match`/
  recursion, no `&optional`/rest params): each closure parameter inherits the
  type the callee expects at the position(s) where the parameter is used
  directly (intersected across positions); the closure's return is the
  callee's. Anything with a branch / binding / recursion → infer nothing.
  Sound **because a straight-line use is unconditional** — no control-flow
  analysis, no fixpoint, no false-positive class. The callee is itself only
  looked up via the *non-inferring* `primitive_sig`/`curated_sig` (so a chain
  `defn a (x) (b x)` / `defn b (x) (a x)` can't loop). Catches one-liner
  wrappers (`inc`, `twice`, simple user `defn`s); skips everything subtle.

**Deferred (⬜):** inference through branches / guards / recursion / higher-order.

### Step 4 — the advisory checker 🟡 (v0 shipped; plan below)
`crates/lisp/src/types/check.rs`: walk a macro-expanded form and **warn when a
call passes a provably-wrong argument** — its type is *disjoint* from what the
callee accepts (`(first 5)`; `(+ 1 "x")` once `+` has a curated sig).
Disjointness (not subtyping) is the rule, so a superset / unknown argument is
never a false positive.

- **Vocabulary: `Option<Ty>`, not `GradualTy`.** The checker only asks "do I know
  this argument's type?": `Some(t)` → check disjointness against the param;
  `None` (a variable, an unknown call) → stay silent. The gradual machinery
  isn't needed until we check *assignments*; the disjointness checker doesn't, so
  it stays out of the hot path.
- **Skip inside `try` / `error-of` / `assert-error`** — those forms deliberately
  exercise failures, so don't flag code within them (keeps `nest test` quiet on
  error-path tests).
- **Advisory, always** — returns warnings; never raises, never gates (contract #5).
- ✅ **v0 shipped:** the `(check 'form)` builtin + `brood --check <file>`
  (located warnings).
- ✅ **Step-3 coverage:** primitive sigs sourced from `NativeFn` (enforced;
  no parallel table), curated stdlib sigs for `+`/`<`/`map`/…, and inference
  for straight-line single-expression closures (so a user `(defn inc (x) (+ x
  1))` participates without a hand-written sig).
- ✅ **Guard narrowing + let-binding tracking** (the second behavioural payoff):
  the checker now threads a `Ctx { sym → Ty }` of locally-known types through
  the walk. A `let`/`let*` binding seeds the variable with the RHS's
  `expr_ty`; an `if`'s test narrows in both branches via [`Ty::tested_by`]
  (`(if (int? x) … …)` ⇒ in the *then* branch `x` is `int`, in the *else* it's
  `not int`); `(not <inner>)` flips. Inner shadowing overrides — a fresh
  binding to an unknown RHS *removes* an outer narrowing rather than
  intersecting (otherwise the outer leaks through the shadow).
- ✅ **Let-bound guard aliases.** `(let (cond (int? x)) (if cond …))` now
  narrows `x` (not the bool `cond`) inside the if. The `Ctx` carries a second
  table `guards: sym → (var, asserted-ty)`; a `let` records the alias when
  the RHS is itself a recognised guard, and `guard_assertion` on a bare `Sym`
  test looks it up. Sound because Brood is immutable — between the let and
  the if neither `x` nor `cond` can change. Self-aliasing (`(let (x (int? x))
  …)`) is rejected (the outer `x` is shadowed).
- ✅ **Let-binding aliases + `%eq` guards** — the pair that closes `match`
  pattern narrowing. The `match` pattern compiler lowers `(match x (5 body)
  …)` to `(let (m__N x) (if (%eq m__N 5) (do body) …))`; `body` references
  `x` (not the internal `m__N`), so narrowing has to flow back. Two pieces
  do it: `Ctx.aliases: HashMap<Symbol, HashSet<Symbol>>` records the
  undirected `(let (a b) …)` equivalence between a name and another symbol,
  and `narrow_chain` BFSes the equivalence class on every narrow so an
  assertion on either side propagates to the other. The guard recogniser
  learns `(%eq sym lit)` (and the symmetric `(%eq lit sym)`) as an assertion
  `sym : type-of(lit)` — covering literal-int, -keyword, -string, -bool, and
  -nil patterns. With both in place, `(match x (5 (first x)))` now flags
  `first: argument 1 expects nil | pair | vector, got int (x)`. `shadow`
  fully disconnects a name from the alias graph (its bin removed and the
  name pruned from every neighbour's bin) so a rebinding doesn't leak
  through stale back-edges. Sound for the same immutability reason as guard
  aliases. (Cond / and / or didn't need any new machinery — `cond`'s direct
  `(pred? sym)` tests and `and`/`or`'s gensym `let`-then-`if` expansion are
  already handled by the existing guard pipeline.)
- ✅ **Arity diagnostics.** Every call's argument count is checked against the
  callee's `Arity` — `NativeFn.arity` for primitives, derived from
  `Closure.{params, optionals, rest}` for Brood closures (in the heap; the
  inferred-sig path applies too). `(first)` → "expected 1, got 0"; `(rem 1 2
  3)` → "expected 2, got 3"; `(map-get {})` → "expected 2 to 3"; `(apply f)`
  → "expected 2 or more". Independent of the type check (which still runs
  for the args that *are* present), so a 1-arg `(first 5)` still says `first:
  argument 1 expects nil | pair | vector, got int (5)`.
- ✅ **Unbound-symbol diagnostics** (call heads). A call whose head doesn't
  resolve to *anything* — not a primitive, not a curated stdlib closure, not
  in local scope (fn-param, let-binding), not a file-local `def`/`defn`/
  `defmacro`/`defdyn`, not a syntactic keyword (`if`/`do`/`when`/`cond`/`and`/
  `or`/`match`/`->`/…), and not in the heap's global table — is flagged
  `unbound symbol: foo`. The walk gained scope-aware handling of `fn` /
  `lambda` / `def` / `defn` / `defmacro` so binders aren't seen as references
  and fn-params get bound into `Ctx`. A new `check_file(heap, &[forms])` API
  threads top-level `def`/`defn` names across forms so a later call to an
  earlier definition isn't flagged. The CLI's `brood --check` now uses
  `check_file`.
- ✅ **Function-as-value lint** (advisory). A bare reference to a *known
  zero-arity* global passed to an output sink (`print` / `println` / `str` /
  `format`) — e.g. `(print ansi-clear)` where `(print (ansi-clear))` was meant —
  is flagged `ansi-clear: function used as a value — did you mean (ansi-clear)?`.
  Catches the otherwise-silent slip where a zero-arg helper stringifies as
  `#<fn …>` instead of being called. Restricted to those sinks and to *globals*
  (a same-named local is left alone) to stay false-positive-free. (The general
  *operand-position* unbound check is still deferred — it needs pattern-binding
  and cross-file-global tracking to avoid false positives; see `todo.md`.)
- ✅ **Auto-running at file boundaries.** The checker now fires automatically:
  `brood <file>` and `brood --test <file>` pre-check before evaluating (CLI
  wiring through `check_one_file`); `nest run` and `nest test` pre-check the
  whole project after loads but before running (Brood `(check-project)` in
  `std/project.blsp` walking every `.blsp` under `src/` + `tests/`). Warnings
  go to **stderr** so they don't muddle program output; the run/test
  **proceeds regardless** (advisory, never gates — `contract #5`). Set
  `BROOD_NO_CHECK=1` to opt out (e.g. when timing a hot path).
  Mechanism: a new `(check-file path)` Rust primitive reads and checks a file,
  returning pre-formatted `path:line:col: warning: …` strings; policy in Brood
  iterates over the project's files via `(check-project)` (the standard
  policy-in-Brood pattern, ADR-006).
- ✅ **Macro-expansion before walking.** `check_file` now macroexpands each
  top-level form before walking it, so threading macros (`->`/`->>`), pattern
  syntax (`match`), test framework wrappers (`test`/`describe`/`error-of`/
  `assert-error`), and any user macro that rearranges code are checked
  against their *expanded* shape — eliminating false positives like
  `(map inc)` inside `(->> xs (map inc))` getting flagged as 1-arg. The
  file-globals accumulator likewise walks the expanded tree recursively, so
  a `(defn foo …)` nested inside `test`/`describe`/etc. still shields a later
  `(foo …)` from the unbound check. Positions survive expansion where the
  macro rebuilds through `rebuild_list` (the common case).
- ✅ **Cond / match / and / or guard narrowing all in.** `cond` flows
  through `if`'s existing `(pred? sym)` recognition; `and` / `or` through
  the `let`-stored guard-alias path (the prelude expansion `(let (g a) (if
  g b g))`); `match` through the new let-binding alias + `%eq` guard. The
  whole Step-4 surface is behavioural now — every form a user reaches for
  on a guarded variable narrows it.
- ✅ **Macro-hygiene lint** (`check/hygiene.rs`). Macros are unhygienic by
  default (ADR-021/no auto-rename), so a `defmacro` template that introduces a
  binder with a *literal* symbol can **capture** caller code spliced into that
  binder's scope — the `(defmacro time (expr) ` `` `(let (start (now) v ~expr) …)) `` ``
  bug, where the body's `start` binds to the clock instead of the caller's.
  The lint warns only when **both** hold for a `let`/`fn` binder inside a
  quasiquote template: (1) the binder is a literal symbol — a gensym'd binder
  reads as `(unquote g)` and an unquoted caller-name as `(unquote evar)`, so
  neither trips it; and (2) a macro *parameter* is spliced (`~p`/`~@p`) into
  that binder's scope (Brood `let` is sequential, so the scope is the body plus
  *later* bindings' values — not the binder's own value). Both conditions are
  syntactic, so this is the one pass that runs over the **un-expanded** forms
  (templates vanish after expansion). Audited over the whole `std/` tree: every
  macro there gensyms or unquotes its binders, so the lint fires **zero** false
  positives (contract #5 holds — advisory, never gates). An intentional
  anaphoric macro (deliberate capture) would be flagged; none exist in-tree, and
  if one is written the lint should grow an opt-out rather than relax the gate.

With everything above, Step 4 is **done**. The only meaningful next move is
project-wide check-only entry points already on tap (`nest check`) and the
upgrade to Step 5+ (structured types) when a real need surfaces.

### Step 5+ — structured types ⬜
Function arrows, vector/list element types, intersections for overloaded fns —
the fuller set-theoretic algebra. Additive; gated on real need (ADR-011). **Note:
this *replaces* the `u16`-bitset representation of `Ty`** (likely an
`enum { Set(u16), Arrow(..), Vec(elem), … }`), it doesn't extend it — which is a
reason to keep the flat lattice lean now rather than over-build on the bitset.

## How it runs — and why it's outside the runtime

The checker is a **pre-step at the file/project boundary**, never woven into
evaluation:

- `brood check <file>` — check a single file (the language binary).
- `nest check` — check the whole project (the CI / editor entry point).
- `brood <file>` — check, then run a file.
- `nest test` — check the project, then run the tests.
- **Not** in the REPL / `load` / per-form `eval` (maybe later) — so there's no
  per-eval noise and no suppression machinery beyond the `try`/`error-of` skip.

**Checking is upstream of hot reload, never part of it.** "Don't reload code we
can already see will fail" is a property of the *workflow that orchestrates the
reload* — today: run `brood check` first; later: the editor's reload command
(itself Brood) checks, then reloads — **not** of the `def`/reload primitive. The
runtime never consults the checker, so: contract #5 holds with **no carve-out**,
there is nothing to override, and a wrong signature can at worst print a stray
warning upstream — it can never wedge a reload. (Reloads should be *atomic* —
broken new code leaves the running version in place — but that's hot-reload
hygiene, independent of the type checker.) The type system stays **entirely
external**: it observes and advises; it is never in the execution or reload path.

Why no inference *engine* (ADR-011): full body inference needs control-flow /
dominance analysis to avoid false positives from *guarded* uses (a param used as
a number only inside `(if (number? x) …)` doesn't make the param a number). That
machinery is the bulk of the complexity and the only false-positive source — so
we cut it, keeping curated sigs + the trivially-sound straight-line case, and add
more only when a concrete need justifies it.

## Compatibility contract

Every change — new primitive, new special form, new `Value` kind, new feature —
must keep these true, so future work stays on the set-theoretic path. Items
marked **(enforced)** are compile errors if violated; the rest are review rules.

1. **Every value has exactly one tag.** The `Tag`s are the type atoms, and a
   tag's `#[repr(u8)]` discriminant *is* its lattice bit. A new `Value` variant
   must get a `Tag` (in `value::tag`, **enforced** — exhaustive match) and be
   added to `types::ALL_TAGS`; `TAG_COUNT`/`UNIVERSE` then follow automatically.
   The `tag_universe_is_consistent` test checks bits are dense and in order, so a
   tag *missing from* or *misordered in* `ALL_TAGS` fails CI (the gap a plain
   match can't catch, since Rust can't enumerate variants). Don't introduce a
   value kind that can't be a tag. **As of `Tag::Rope` (ADR-045) there are 16
   tags — the `Ty(u16)` lattice is now full.** `UNIVERSE` computes in `u32` and
   narrows to dodge the `1u16 << 16` const-overflow; a *17th* tag must widen `Ty`
   to `u32` (the `TAG_COUNT <= 16` assert in `types/mod.rs` is the tripwire).
2. **A type is a set of values.** Don't add a typing concept that isn't a set
   (no nominal-only identity, no escape hatch that breaks set semantics).
   Structured types arrive as proper set-theoretic extensions, never bolt-ons.
3. **Subtyping is inclusion.** Never add an ad-hoc subtyping rule. `a <: b` iff
   `a`'s value set ⊆ `b`'s — full stop. This is precisely what keeps us off the
   TypeScript route.
4. **Redefinable bindings are `dynamic()`, never assumed static.** Any feature
   touching `def` / globals / hot reload must keep them `dynamic()` so a checker
   can never contradict a future redefinition. This is the "don't inhibit the
   language" invariant.
5. **Checking is advisory.** No change may let a type result *reject* a runnable
   program — except provably-sound special-form *structure* errors (special forms
   aren't redefinable, so those can't be wrong). Types warn and optimise; they
   never gate.
6. **Every primitive declares its type. (enforced)** A new builtin supplies a
   result `Ty` (+ arg `Ty`s) next to its `Arity` — `NativeFn` carries a `Sig`
   field, the same mechanism that makes `Arity` mandatory: omitting it is a
   compile error. The "no useful info" case uses `Sig::any()` (overlaps every
   input, never warns), so the contract holds for permissive builtins too.
7. **Policy in Brood.** If a type test or contract can be written in Brood over
   `type-of`/predicates, it goes in `std/`, not Rust (ADR-006).
8. **Pattern/guard forms expose their refinement.** New pattern kinds or guards
   must remain analysable for occurrence typing — the matcher is the inference
   goldmine (step 4). Don't add opaque guards that hide the type they imply.
9. **Errors, `type-of`, and `Ty` agree on names.** All use `Tag::name`
   spellings, so a `Ty` in a message reads the same as `type-of` returns.

## Where it lives

(After the `core/` / `syntax/` / `eval/` / `types/` module split.)

- `crates/lisp/src/types/mod.rs` — the `Ty` lattice (step 1), `GradualTy`
  (step 2), and `tested_by` (the guard-narrowing bridge for step 4).
- `crates/lisp/src/types/check.rs` — the advisory checker: the signature sources
  (step 3) and the disjointness walk (step 4).
- `crates/lisp/src/core/value.rs` — `Tag` (the atoms), `value::tag`, `NativeFn`
  (gains a signature when step 3's table moves onto it).
- `crates/lisp/src/eval/mod.rs` — `call_native` (the arity gate).
- `crates/lisp/src/eval/macros.rs` — `macroexpand_all`, the pass the checker runs
  after.
